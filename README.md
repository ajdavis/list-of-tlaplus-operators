A list of all TLA+ operators. For each I show its rendered display, its ASCII
notation, and its meaning.

Work in progress.

You can't create columns in TLA+ itself, so I've copied the TLA+ TeX style from
Lamport and handwritten a 3-column TeX file instead.

Requires pdflatex. I've had success with pdflatex from
[TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) on Mac. 

Run `all-operators.py` to generate a PDF table and also a CSV file. The latter
is suitable for importing into Anki as flashcards.
