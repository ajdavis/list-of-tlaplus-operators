TLA+ symbols
============

A list of [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html) symbols, which
can be rendered as a PDF or used as flashcards.
For each I show its rendered display, its ASCII notation, and its meaning if I
have learned it.

A work in progress.

Install and run
---------------

Requires Python 3.6 or later, and pdflatex. I've had success with pdflatex from
[TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) on Mac. 

Run `all-operators.py` to generate a PDF and a CSV file. The latter
is suitable for importing into Anki as flashcards.



FAQ
---

## What about the other lists of TLA+ symbols?

In "Specifying Systems", the table of ASCII representations and the symbols
shown in the book's index are differently incomplete, and the same goes for the
symbols in the TLA+ Toolkit's help. In this project I try to include all symbols
I expect to encounter.
