A list of all TLA+ operators. For each I show its rendered display, its ASCII
notation, and its meaning.

Work in progress.

You can't create columns in TLA+ itself, so I've copied the TLA+ TeX style from
Lamport and handwritten a 3-column TeX file instead. Use pdflatex or similar
to regenerate the PDF after editing the TeX. I've had success with pdflatex from
[TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) on Mac.
